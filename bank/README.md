## Goal
Develop a program to manage the transactions of a bank account.

The transactions are: deposit money into the account, and withdraw from the account.

We need to be able to print into the console the result.
## Requirement
You cannot change the signature of the public interface (the class AccountService).
## Code
	class AccountService {
      // <summary>
     	//   Add an amount into the account.
      // </summary>
      public void Deposit(int amount)
      {
      }

      // <summary>
      //   Remove an amount from the account.
      // </summary>
      public void Withdraw($amount)
      {
      }

      // <summary>
      //   Print the statements containing all the transactions in the console
      // </summary>
      public void PrintStatements()
      {
      }
	}
